    <h1>Literally Littered</h1>
    <p>
      If you live in the city you see it every day. But, did you know that
      because of this litter, the litter that is just a part of every day life,
      there is an island of trash two times the size of Texas floating in the
      Pacific ocean? Just think about that. You know how big your city is? Now
      think of your state. Now Texas. Now think of two of Texas side by side.
      Now imagine that is made of trash. That is a lot of trash, and the sea
      life is dying because of it.

      The U.S. spends 11.5 billion dollars on litter clean up every year
      (Source). You can help by doing these few things. You can STOP LITTERING.
      You could also volunteer for programs like Keep America Beautifulâ€™s annual
      Great American Cleanup, or just volunteer at you local park to do a park
      cleanup. Or even if your walking down the street and see some litter, pick
      it up and throw it away, every bit helps.
